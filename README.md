The platform begins with a Home Page featuring options to log in or register. Upon successful
registration, user credentials are securely stored in a database, ensuring data privacy and accessibility.
After logging in, users are directed to an intuitive Dashboard showcasing four primary insurance
categories: Home, Life, Car, and Health. Each category presents a curated list of companies offering
related policies.
When a user selects a company, they are redirected to a detailed page containing the company's policy
information. To enhance user convenience, a Summarize Button is provided on this page. There is a
Download Button which will download the given insurance pdf which should be uploaded above the
summarize option. Clicking the button generates a concise summary of the policy details on a new
page.
The summarized page includes a Redirect Button that allows users to return seamlessly to the Home
Page of the insurance companyâ€™s website. Additionally, every page is equipped with a Navigation
Bar to facilitate easy movement between previous pages, ensuring a user-friendly browsing
experience.
This project emphasizes a streamlined, accessible, and user-centric approach to exploring and
understanding insurance policies. By integrating features such as text summarization, and a responsive
design, our platform aims to empower users to make informed decisions with minimal effort. The
system not only improves user engagement but also enhances accessibility, contributing to a more
inclusive and efficient way to manage insurance-related tasks.
The application is designed with robust architecture, including a secure backend for data management
and a dynamic frontend for intuitive user interaction, making it a valuable tool for individuals seeking
clarity and simplicity in the insurance domain
